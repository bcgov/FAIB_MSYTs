Utilizing silviculture data in RESULTS to generate Managed Stand Yield Tables

The Reporting Silviculture Updates and Land Status Tracking System (RESULTS) application tracks silviculture information by managing the submission of openings, disturbances, silviculture activities and obligation declarations as required by the Forest and Range Practices Act.  <https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/silviculture-reporting-results>

RESULTS data is being incorporated into the Timber Supply Review (TSR) process to generate managed stand yield tables (MSYTs).  This includes:
- planted information
- INVENTORY survey information
- adjustment to planting using the INVENTORY survey to account for mortality and ingress 
- genetic worth
