# Introduction 


Batch Tipsy Composer (BTC) has been around since the first production runs of the MSYTs for TSR.  It initially provided an efficient CSV interface that got around the strict and old school format specification for the batch version of Tipsy.  

While many of you are probably familiar with the Tipsy 4.4 and 4.5, BTC has a much different interface.  


![](images/BTC_init_screen.PNG)

Please not that this is version 1.1.8.0 BETA, February 27, 2023.  

The intent is to have this product ready for general release sometime this spring.  

So for now, use wisely.....

# BTC and example inputs

The BETA version of BTC is available here: 


\\G:\!Transfr\MSYT_Delivery\BatchTipsy

Copy to your local drive c:\data\localapps

- BTC20230227.zip

Unzip just the BTC component  

Also grab the sample data file

- MSYT_sample.csv


# Model (Intro) Tab Options

The Model tab opens when BTC is instanciated and allows the user to specify a number of options.  In general, the interface has been tailored for TSR use in terms of preset defaults, but it is always good practice to check and see what is turned on and what is turend off.  It may surprise you and we don't want that. 



## Species

Ignore this for now.  This is hard wired.

## Utilization

The default show be set to TSR utilization specifications.  

![](images/BTC_utilization.PNG)

The default should be: Everything 17.5 except Interior Pl and Coast Old Growth 12.5

This can be interpreted as:

- Interior Pl: 12.5
- Interior Other Species: 17.5
- Coast: All species 12.5

- Deciduous Interior : 17.5
- Deciduous Coast: 12.5



## OAFs

BTC has a variety of OAFs that are user selectable:

![](images/BTC_oafs.PNG)

In our case, we will be using the following:

- OAF1
- OAF2
- DR
- AT

The other OAFs:

- AmV
- AmM
- DSG
- CSC

require local information and are not normally used.  

We are using the OAFS provided for Alder (DR) and Aspen (AT).  Note that in the volume output tables, you will notice the decline in deciduous volume.  

### DR OAF

![](images/BTC_dr_oaf.PNG)

### AT OAF

![](images/BTC_at_oaf.PNG)



## Stock Height

not used

## Genetic Worth

This is overwritten by the 5 genetic worth columns in the input table.  
(or at least it had better be)

## Fertilizaiton Response

not used

## Table Specifications

BTC tables are capped at age = 120.  This was a group decision that included the Stand Development Modelling group, the YSM group and TSR folk.  

The default setting for BTC should be: 

![](images/BTC_table_specs.PNG)

0-120:10|# MAX=120 INC=10

So stands are capped at 120 years and the age incerment is 10.

## Reports / Graphs

ignore

## Settings

ignore

# Input Tab

The next main tab is the Input tab,  This tab allows the user to select the type if format for the input tables.  In the case of TSR, we use a very specific format that is represented in a CSV file.  

## Overview of Input

![](images/BTC_inputs.PNG)

Once you have selected the TSR MSYT input format (csv) you may encounter 2 pop up boxes:


![](images/BTC_si_warning.PNG)

![](images/BTC_nat_delay.PNG)

Click yes to both of these.  We are sorting out the defaults for what BTC defines as Natural delay.  



![](images/BTC_processing.PNG)

Once you have selected your input file the first few rows will appear.  It is important to note that there are 4 main sections to each input row:

## Identifier Section

![](images/BTC_input1.PNG)

The first section supplies the row identifier (in this case feature_id), as well as the BEC zone and subzone.  
Note that BTC has a know list of BEC and if supplied with something unknown an ERROR will occur.

## Planted Composition

![](images/BTC_input2.PNG)

The second section represents the planted component of the stand and shows:

- Planted Species (1-5)
- Planted Species Density (1-5)
- Genetic Worth by species (1-5)
- Planting Delay
- Percent Planted (0-100)

## Natural Composition
![](images/BTC_input3.PNG)

The third section represents the natrual component of the stands and shows:

- Natural Species (1-5)
- Natural Species Density (1-5)

## Other attribution

![](images/BTC_input4.PNG)

The fourth section shows:

- OAF1
- OAF2
- Opening_id (optional) 

  
  
- vri reference age (for pre 1987 stands)
- vri ref density (for pre 1987 stands)  

 
- Site Index values for all 22 PSPL species

## Different from Tipsy 4.5 

Note that this format differs significantly from previous version of generic TIPSY.  It allows for:

- mixed conifer species
- mixed conifer deciduous species
- mixed planted and natural species (Controlled by planted_percent)



You might ask why we are referencing OAFs in the input when we were asked to tick some OAF boxes at the beginning.  I am asking those questions myself and waiting for an answer.

## The GO Button

![](images/BTC_go_button.PNG)

Well BTC doesn't actually have button called go, but there is once called Start Processing.

![](images/BTC_start_processing.PNG)

## BTC Input Example

Consider the following stand description:

![](images/BTC_s1.PNG)
![](images/BTC_s2.PNG)
![](images/BTC_s3.PNG)


This shows a 100% planted stand, with the natural component all NULL.

You can have a 100% planted stand with the natural component being NON NULL.  
Because the planted % = 100, BTC will ignore the natural component.  

Note that a species site index is required for each species in the valid species composition, otherwise an ERROR message. 


## BTC output

![](images/BTC_proc_issues.PNG)

Note at the bottom that it lists the Error File  
with Warnings and Errors.  

In this case there were none.  

![](images/BTC_out1.PNG)

![](images/BTC_out2.PNG)

Output is single row per identifier,  with:

- merch conifer volume (MVcon_) at age 0-120
- merch deciduous volume (MVdec_) at age 0-120

In a single row.  




## BTC Errors & warnings

I have deleted one of the se_si values where Se is in th especies composition.

![](images/BTC_error1.PNG)

And if we look at the error file:

There are three lines documenting the error:

    Error	2:48:11	No direct Site Index	
    The treatment unit 'Planted' doesn't contain either;  
    an Age/Height pair, a User Site Index, or a Provincial Productivity Site Index

    Warning	2:48:11	Species Missing Provincial Site Productivity	 
    This species Is missing a Provincial Site Productivity site index!	
    Se 

    Warning	2:48:11	Site Index for 'Poor' Site Class	
    SI not entered, calculated from POOR Site class	Se

The last message is warning us that BTC tried to find an alternative site index from poor site class for Se but couldn't find one.  

It is best to provide everything that BTC needs and avoid going to default site index values. 

Changing one of the Se planted densities to 8000 gives these warnings:

    Warning	3:02:27	Reduced Stems/ha	8,000 using max available of 4,444	Se
    Warning	3:02:27	Reduced Stems/ha	8,000 using max available of 4,444	Se


There are warnings for:

- site index too high
- site index too low
- exceeding maximum density for a species
- going below the minimum density for a species

In theory, for the Provincial release, there should be no errors and the warnings have been examined and accounted for.
