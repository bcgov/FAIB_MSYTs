Figure 1.  MSYT Process Flow


The MSYT process combines planted information derived from RESULTS with the changes shown by the Forest Cover INV survey to account for ingress and mortality.  It is made up of a planted component and a natural component.

## Planted Component

### Inputs

| RESULTS Planting | SPAR | Provincial Site Productivity |
|:-----------------|:------------|:-----------|
| Opening Based |  Genetic Worth | Site index by species | 
| Number Planted (by Species) | |
| Area Planted (by Species) | | |


### Outputs
| Planted Component |
|:-------------------|
| Opening based |
| Planted Species Composition |
| Planted Density (initial) |
| Planted Genetic Worth |
| Planting Delay |



## Natural Component

### Inputs

| RESULTS Forest Cover INV (Survey) |
|:-------------------|
| Opening based |
| Natural Species Composition |
| Density (at survey, total sph) |

### Outputs

| Natural Component|
|:-------|
|  Opening based |
| Species composition (as time of survey)|
| Species density |
 
 
## Assess for Ingress/Mortality
  
The planted composition is adjusted based on the Forest Cover INV survey to account for ingress and mortality.  The final species composition used as input to a growth and yield model is comprised of both a planted and a natural component.

| Planted Component | Natural Component|
|:-------------------|:----------|
| Planted Species Composition | Natural Species Composition |
| Planted Density | Natural Density |
| Planted Genetic Worth | |
| Planting Delay | |
| Percent Planted | |



## GY Model inputs

The planted percent controls how much weight is assigned to the planted component.  There can be stands with either 100% planted or 0% planted.  A 0% planted stand is treated as an natural stand and assigned random spacing in the GY model.

## Yield Tables
